# Crystalline Giant Tracker

## 🎴 What is this?

This is a **simple web app** to help Magic: The Gathering players easily keep track of the counters on **Crystalline Giant**.

The Crystalline Giant card gives itself a random counter at the beginning of combat on your turn — it can be hard to remember which counters you’ve already added, especially during long games or when distractions happen at the table.

## 💡 Why was this created?

When playing Crystalline Giant, it's easy to lose track of which counters it has gained so far. Paper tokens or mental notes can be unreliable, and you don’t always want to bring extra physical tracking aids.

This app solves that by providing a **visual, digital way** to:

- Randomly roll for a new counter each turn.
- Clearly show which counters are already active.
- Remember your counters even if you reload the page or close your browser (via local storage).
- Reset easily and start again when the game is over.
